# Beta Security Monitoring & Incident Response Plan

**Extension**: Semantest ChatGPT Browser Extension (Beta)  
**Version**: 2.0.0-beta  
**Effective Date**: January 20, 2025  
**Security Team Contact**: security@semantest.com  
**Incident Hotline**: [TBD]

## üîç Security Monitoring Strategy

### Real-Time Monitoring Requirements

#### 1. User Activity Monitoring
```javascript
// Monitor for suspicious patterns
const SUSPICIOUS_PATTERNS = {
  excessiveApiCalls: 100,      // per minute
  dataExfiltration: 50,         // MB per hour
  crossOriginRequests: 20,      // per minute
  errorThreshold: 50            // per hour
};
```

**Metrics to Track**:
- API call frequency per user
- Data transfer volumes
- Cross-origin request patterns
- Error rates and types
- Unusual automation patterns

#### 2. System Health Monitoring
- Extension crash frequency
- Memory usage spikes
- CPU utilization patterns
- Network request anomalies
- Storage usage growth

#### 3. Security Event Detection
- XSS attempt indicators
- Unauthorized data access
- Permission escalation attempts
- Malicious pattern injection
- WebSocket hijacking attempts

## üö® Incident Response Plan

### Severity Levels

| Level | Description | Response Time | Examples |
|-------|-------------|---------------|----------|
| **P0 - Critical** | Active exploitation, data breach | < 30 minutes | XSS attack in progress, data exfiltration |
| **P1 - High** | Security vulnerability discovered | < 2 hours | New XSS vector found, permission bypass |
| **P2 - Medium** | Potential security issue | < 24 hours | Suspicious patterns, high error rates |
| **P3 - Low** | Minor security concern | < 72 hours | Performance degradation, minor bugs |

### Incident Response Procedures

#### Phase 1: Detection & Triage (0-30 minutes)

1. **Automated Detection**
   ```yaml
   triggers:
     - error_rate > 50/hour
     - data_transfer > 50MB/hour
     - xss_attempts > 5/hour
     - unauthorized_access > 1
   ```

2. **Manual Detection Sources**
   - User reports via security email
   - Beta tester feedback
   - Monitoring dashboard alerts
   - Log analysis anomalies

3. **Initial Assessment**
   - [ ] Identify affected components
   - [ ] Determine severity level
   - [ ] Estimate user impact
   - [ ] Check for active exploitation

#### Phase 2: Containment (30-60 minutes)

**P0/P1 Incidents - Immediate Actions**:

1. **Emergency Disable** (if needed)
   ```javascript
   // Kill switch implementation
   const EMERGENCY_DISABLE = {
     disableExtension: true,
     blockAllRequests: true,
     notifyUsers: true,
     preserveData: true
   };
   ```

2. **Limit Damage**
   - [ ] Disable affected features
   - [ ] Block malicious patterns
   - [ ] Revoke compromised permissions
   - [ ] Isolate affected users

3. **Preserve Evidence**
   - [ ] Capture logs
   - [ ] Save memory dumps
   - [ ] Document timeline
   - [ ] Screenshot evidence

#### Phase 3: Investigation (1-4 hours)

1. **Root Cause Analysis**
   - Review code changes
   - Analyze attack vectors
   - Identify vulnerability source
   - Determine exploitation method

2. **Impact Assessment**
   ```yaml
   assessment_checklist:
     - users_affected: count
     - data_exposed: type and volume
     - systems_compromised: list
     - attack_duration: timeframe
     - attacker_identification: IP/patterns
   ```

3. **Evidence Collection**
   - Server logs
   - Client-side errors
   - Network traffic captures
   - User reports

#### Phase 4: Remediation (2-24 hours)

1. **Emergency Patch Development**
   - [ ] Develop security fix
   - [ ] Test in isolated environment
   - [ ] Verify fix effectiveness
   - [ ] Prepare deployment

2. **Deployment Strategy**
   ```yaml
   deployment:
     stage_1: Internal testing (30 min)
     stage_2: Limited beta rollout (1 hour)
     stage_3: Full beta deployment (2 hours)
     validation: Continuous monitoring
   ```

3. **Validation Checklist**
   - [ ] Vulnerability patched
   - [ ] No regression issues
   - [ ] Performance acceptable
   - [ ] Monitoring active

#### Phase 5: Recovery & Lessons Learned (24-72 hours)

1. **User Communication**
   ```markdown
   Subject: Security Incident - Action Required
   
   Dear Beta Tester,
   
   We detected a security incident affecting [component].
   
   Actions Taken:

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

1. This plan is specifically for BETA phase with known vulnerabilities
2. Production release will require enhanced security measures
3. All incidents must be documented regardless of severity
4. Beta testers must be notified of any security incidents
5. Legal team must review any public disclosures

**Remember**: In security incidents, speed and accuracy are equally important. When in doubt, escalate.
