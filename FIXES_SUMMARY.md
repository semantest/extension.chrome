# Image Generation Fixes Summary

## Problems Reported by User

1. **Multiple old images downloading** when addon receives the event
2. **Extension context invalidated** error
3. **Image generates successfully** but not downloaded
4. **Monitoring stops after 2 minutes** before image is ready

## Fixes Implemented

### 1. Extended Monitoring Timeout (3 minutes)
- Changed from 2 minutes to 3 minutes to accommodate slow image generation
- Matches the CLI timeout of 120 seconds with extra buffer

### 2. Prevent Old Image Downloads
- Track all existing images before monitoring starts
- Only download images that appear AFTER monitoring begins
- Don't check existing images immediately on start
- Only check NEW messages for images

### 3. Smarter Image Detection
- Check if we're expecting an image (flag-based)
- Integration with state detector to know when generation is complete
- Only check recent messages (last 3) to avoid historical images
- Better URL pattern matching for DALL-E images

### 4. Better Error Handling
- Wrapped bridge communication in try-catch blocks
- Handle "Extension context invalidated" errors gracefully
- Continue with download even if can't notify extension

### 5. Improved Monitoring Strategy
- Monitor only NEW messages, not existing ones
- Track message count to detect new messages
- Wait for images to fully load before downloading
- Stop monitoring after successful download

## Key Code Changes

### image-downloader.js
```javascript
// Track monitoring state
let monitoringStartTime = null;
let initialImages = new Set();
let expectingImage = false;

// Only check NEW messages
let lastMessageCount = document.querySelectorAll('[data-testid="conversation-turn"]').length;

// Don't download old images
if (initialImages.has(src)) {
  return false;
}

// Extended timeout
setTimeout(() => {
  stopImageMonitoring();
  console.log('⏱️ Stopped monitoring after 3 minutes (timeout)');
}, 180000); // 3 minutes
```

## Testing Needed

1. Generate a new image and verify:
   - No old images are downloaded
   - Only the newly generated image is downloaded
   - Download happens even if generation takes >2 minutes
   - No "context invalidated" errors break the flow

2. Monitor console logs for:
   - "Found X existing images" at start
   - "New message detected!" when image appears
   - "Found NEW generated image" for the target image
   - "Download complete" confirmation

## Remaining Work

1. Further testing with actual image generation
2. Possible enhancement: Use image hash/fingerprint for better duplicate detection
3. Consider adding retry logic for failed downloads
4. Improve integration with state detector for more precise timing
