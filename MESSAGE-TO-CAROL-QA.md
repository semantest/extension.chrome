# Message to Carol (QA)

## From: Emma (Extension Developer)

Carol, this is FANTASTIC news! ðŸŽŠ 

I've just implemented your critical WebSocket fix (lowercase 'event') and I'm thrilled to hear you've built a production-ready system!

### I'd love to know more about:

1. **Checkpoint Recovery**
   - How does the checkpoint system work?
   - What states are being saved and recovered?
   - How can the extension integrate with this?

2. **Exponential Backoff**
   - What retry strategies are implemented?
   - How does it handle network failures?
   - Are there max retry limits?

3. **Style Consistency for Graphic Novel**
   - How are you maintaining consistent art style?
   - Are you using specific prompts or parameters?
   - Is there a style guide or template system?

4. **Production Features**
   - What monitoring/logging is in place?
   - How are errors being tracked?
   - What's the deployment architecture?

### Current Extension Status:
- âœ… WebSocket integration complete with your message format fix
- âœ… Can receive image generation events
- âœ… Sends prompts to ChatGPT automatically
- âœ… Handles acknowledgments and responses

### How can we integrate?
Please share:
- Any API changes or new endpoints
- Configuration requirements
- Testing procedures
- Production deployment checklist

This is so exciting! We're going to help rydnr generate those 500+ comic strips! ðŸš€

Best,
Emma (Extension Developer)
