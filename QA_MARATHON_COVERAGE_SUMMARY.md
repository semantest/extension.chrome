## Files with Tests but Issues:

1. **file-download.test.ts** - Created but failing due to TypeScript-EDA issues
2. **storage.test.ts** - Created but IndexedDB mock issues
3. **pattern-manager.test.ts** - Created but Chrome storage API issues
4. **configuration.test.ts** - Created but test setup issues
5. **training-ui.test.ts** - Created and passing but coverage not reflected

## Key Achievements:

- Started at ~45% coverage
- Reached 56.76% coverage (11.76% gain!)
- 3.24% away from 60% milestone
- 8 files with >85% coverage
- 5 files with 90%+ coverage
- 2 files with 100% coverage

## Next Steps to Reach 60%:

1. Fix failing tests (file-download, storage, pattern-manager)
2. Get accurate coverage report with all passing tests
3. Test smaller utility files
4. Focus on files with existing test infrastructure

## Blockers:

1. Many tests failing due to TypeScript compilation errors
2. Chrome API mocking issues
3. IndexedDB mocking issues
4. Coverage report includes many untested files, skewing percentages
