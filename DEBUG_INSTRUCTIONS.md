# Debug Instructions for Image Download Issue

I've added comprehensive debug logging to help identify why the download isn't happening. 

## Steps to Debug:

1. **Pull the latest changes:**
   ```bash
   git pull
   ```

2. **Reload the extension** in Chrome

3. **Run the image generation script:**
   ```bash
   ./generate-image.sh "your prompt here"
   ```

4. **After the image appears**, open the Chrome DevTools console and run:
   ```javascript
   window.chatGPTImageDownloader.debugCheckAllImages()
   ```

## What the Debug Function Shows:

- All images found on the page
- Which ones match DALL-E URL patterns (oaiusercontent.com, etc.)
- Detailed checks for each image:
  - URL patterns check
  - Location check (is it in a message?)
  - Size check
  - Why it passes or fails

## Additional Logging:

The enhanced logging will also show:
- When the MutationObserver triggers (👁️ MutationObserver triggered)
- When new images are detected (🆕 New element with images)
- The complete flow through isGeneratedImage (🔍 isGeneratedImage checking)
- Whether the coordinator is checking images after generation (🎯 Coordinator)

## What to Look For:

1. Is the MutationObserver triggering when the image appears?
2. Is the image URL being detected with the correct pattern?
3. Is the image passing the location check (in a message)?
4. Is the size check passing?
5. Are there any error messages?

Please share the complete console output after running these steps, and I'll identify the exact issue preventing the download.
