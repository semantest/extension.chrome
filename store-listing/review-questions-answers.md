# Chrome Web Store Review Questions & Answers

## Common Review Questions

### 1. What is the single purpose of your extension?
**Answer**: Semantest enables web automation within ChatGPT by allowing users to record, replay, and automate repetitive web tasks using natural language commands. It transforms ChatGPT into an intelligent automation assistant.

### 2. Why does your extension need host permissions for all URLs?
**Answer**: Users need to automate tasks on any website they choose. The <all_urls> permission allows the extension to work on any site the user decides to automate, from e-commerce sites to internal business applications. The extension only activates on sites where the user explicitly starts a recording or replay.

### 3. How does your extension use the permissions requested?

**Detailed Permission Usage**:
- **activeTab**: Only accesses the current tab when user clicks record/replay
- **scripting**: Injects automation scripts to interact with page elements
- **storage**: Saves recorded workflows locally in the browser
- **downloads**: Allows users to export their automation scripts
- **notifications**: Shows status updates for long-running automations
- **host_permissions**: Enables automation on user-selected websites

### 4. Does your extension collect user data?
**Answer**: No. All automation data is stored locally in the user's browser. We do not collect, transmit, or store any personal information or browsing data. The only optional data collection is error reporting, which users must explicitly opt into.

### 5. How does the ChatGPT integration work?
**Answer**: The extension adds automation controls to the ChatGPT interface through content scripts. Users can describe automation tasks in natural language, and the extension translates these into executable workflows. All processing happens locally in the browser.

### 6. Is this extension affiliated with OpenAI?
**Answer**: No, Semantest is an independent project that enhances ChatGPT's capabilities but is not affiliated with, endorsed by, or sponsored by OpenAI.

### 7. How do you ensure user privacy?
**Answer**: 
- All data stored locally using Chrome storage API
- No external server communication
- No analytics or tracking by default
- Open source code for transparency
- Clear privacy policy at semantest.com/privacy

### 8. What makes this extension different from other automation tools?
**Answer**: 
- Deep integration with ChatGPT for natural language control
- Self-healing selectors that adapt to page changes
- No coding required - record with clicks
- AI-powered element detection
- Built on the open Semantest framework

### 9. How do you handle security?
**Answer**:
- Content scripts run in isolated contexts
- No eval() or dynamic code execution
- Permissions requested only when needed
- Regular security audits
- Open source for community review

### 10. What if websites break the automation?
**Answer**: Semantest uses intelligent element detection that finds elements even when pages change. Our self-healing technology uses multiple strategies (semantic HTML, visual position, text content) to locate elements reliably.
