# QA Test Report from Frontend

## Extension Status Analysis

### ✅ WORKING:
1. **Version**: Correctly set to v1.0.0-beta in build/manifest.json
2. **Icons**: All icon assets present (16, 48, 128)
3. **Permissions**: Properly configured for ChatGPT domains
4. **BETA Badge**: Implemented in build/popup.html
5. **File Structure**: All necessary files present in build/

### ❌ CRITICAL ISSUES:
1. **popup.js**: Contains Web-Buddy code instead of Semantest
   - This will completely break the extension functionality
   - No project management features will work
   - No custom instructions will work
   
2. **popup.css**: Missing from build directory
   - All styling will be broken
   - Dark mode won't work
   - Responsive design won't work

### ⚠️ CANNOT TEST:
Without Chrome browser access, I cannot:
- Load the extension
- Test actual functionality
- Verify ChatGPT integration
- Check for console errors

## Recommendations for QA:

### If You Have Chrome Access:
1. **DO NOT** load the extension yet - it will fail due to wrong popup.js
2. Wait for Frontend to fix popup.js first
3. Copy popup.css to build/ directory manually for now

### Test Priorities Once Fixed:
1. Basic popup opening
2. Project dropdown functionality
3. Custom instructions saving
4. Theme toggle (light/dark)
5. Connection to ChatGPT
6. Error handling

## Next Steps:
1. Frontend fixing popup.js implementation
2. Frontend ensuring CSS copies to build/
3. Then QA can begin testing

**Status**: 0/6 features can be tested until popup.js is fixed
