# URGENT Browser Tests Required - ChatGPT Extension v1.0.0

**CRITICAL**: Need someone with Chrome browser access to test these IMMEDIATELY!

## üö® PRIORITY 1: Privacy Compliance (BLOCKER)

### Telemetry Consent Popup Test
**Why Critical**: Chrome Web Store requires privacy consent for telemetry

**Steps**:
1. Install extension fresh (no prior data)
2. **EXPECTED**: Notification popup should appear asking for telemetry consent
3. **CHECK**: Can user click "Allow" or "Deny"?
4. **VERIFY**: Choice is saved and respected

**If NO popup appears**: CRITICAL PRIVACY VIOLATION - DO NOT SHIP!
