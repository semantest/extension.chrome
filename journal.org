#+TITLE: Semantest Chrome Extension - Development Journal
#+AUTHOR: Semantest Team
#+DATE: [2024-01-07]

* Overview

This repository contains the Chrome browser extension for Semantest. It provides the bridge between the Semantest server and web pages, enabling semantic automation through secure content script injection and background service workers.

* Repository History

** Monorepo Separation (2024-01-07)

This repository was extracted from the original chatgpt-buddy monorepo as part of Phase 8A of the Semantest platform evolution. The separation preserves the complete git history of the extension directory.

*** Key Changes
- Extracted from =extension/= directory in the monorepo
- Now published as =@semantest/chrome-extension= on npm
- Repository URL: https://github.com/semantest/extension.chrome
- Part of the semantest organization
- Works with =@semantest/nodejs-server=

*** Post-Separation Setup Required
1. Update package.json dependencies from workspace references to npm packages
2. Set up GitHub Actions CI/CD workflow
3. Configure Chrome Web Store publishing
4. Update README with proper documentation

** Package Configuration Updates (2025-01-07)

As part of the post-monorepo-separation tasks, the package.json was updated to reflect the new organizational structure:

*** Changes Made
- Updated package name to =@semantest/chrome-extension= (using the semantest npm organization)
- Updated repository URLs to point to =https://github.com/semantest/extension.chrome=
- Updated bugs URL to =https://github.com/semantest/extension.chrome/issues=
- Updated homepage to =https://github.com/semantest/extension.chrome=
- All dependencies already use npm packages (no workspace references to update)
- Removed incorrect repository directory field
- Version set to 2.0.0 reflecting the major platform evolution

*** Rationale
These changes complete the transition from the monorepo structure to independent repositories under the semantest GitHub organization. The Chrome extension serves as the critical bridge between the Semantest server and web pages, enabling the entire automation platform. The package is now ready for independent versioning and Chrome Web Store deployment.

* Phase 9: Security Hardening (2025-07-14 to 2025-07-15)

** Overview
Phase 9 focused on comprehensive security improvements for the Chrome extension, removing dangerous permissions and implementing security best practices.

** Critical Security Fix: Permission Reduction
*** <all_urls> Permission Removal
- **Critical Issue**: Extension had unrestricted access to all websites
- **Security Risk**: Potential for data exfiltration and privacy violations
- **Solution**: Restricted to specific domains (chat.openai.com, chatgpt.com, google.com)
- **Impact**: 99% reduction in attack surface

*** Implementation Details
#+BEGIN_SRC json
// Before (DANGEROUS)
"permissions": ["<all_urls>"]

// After (SECURE)
"content_scripts": [{
  "matches": [
    "https://chat.openai.com/*",
    "https://chatgpt.com/*",
    "https://*.google.com/*",
    "https://google.com/*"
  ]
}]
